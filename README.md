Public website, tips, tutorials and more about technologies of the information

# Objective
In this repository you can see tips, tutorials and more about technologies, on blog format or similar to wiki layout i publish diferent things; but the main line is about my day of day in my work, using git, configuring servers or programming on multiple languages.

And i want publish on english, too. Because my maternal language are spanish (from Mexico) i want share more about me on english language, for get more practice.

# Why Github?
Because the content is only added, and i don't change it, i think buy one server or hosting space is bad idea. I had a blog with Drupal, and before that my blog was function with Wordpress, but a lot of things what i published was only funny pictures or reference to other tutorials, so i need more about that, i want publish some content about specific point and share that with anyone.

Github is the best way for share the content about technologies, programming and develop, but i don't want to be worried about update CMS or apply security patches. And only are one person publishing content, me; and the flow for edit, publish and share with CMS is bigger for only one person.
